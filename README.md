Till tech test
==============

![a till](/images/till.jpg)

We want to sell tills to local hipster coffee shop who are finally embracing the 21st century. We need a new till to replace their vintage machines - unfortunately, hipster staff are too cool to learn a new system, so we need you to build something that they will understand.

Specification
-------------

This is what a sample receipt looks like:

Version 1
---------

Implement a system that can produce receipts similar to this. A sample `.json` file has been provided with the list of products sold at this particular coffee shop.
Your receipt must calculate and show the correct amount of tax (in this shop's case, 8.64%). Do not worry about calculating discounts at this point!

Version 2
---------

Add functionality to handle discounts - in this example, a 5% discount on orders over $50, and a 10% muffin discount.

Version 3
---------

Implement an interface.
